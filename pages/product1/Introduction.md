There are two separate Hygieia dashboards. One dashboard is for engineers and thus offers metrics, among other details, in an extremely drilled down manner. These dashboards are as follows:

- Team Dashboard
- Product Dashboard

The other dashboard is intended for executives who, if they so choose, can either read at a higher level or can opt to also dig into additional details. For information on this dashboard, see the [Hygieia Executive](https://hygieia.github.io/ExecDashboard/Introduction.html) documentation.
