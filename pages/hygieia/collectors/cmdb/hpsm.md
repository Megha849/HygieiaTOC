Configure the HPSM Collector to display and monitor information (related to configuration management) on the Hygieia Dashboard, from HP Service Manager. Hygieia uses Spring Boot to package the collector as an executable JAR file with dependencies.

### Setup Instructions

To configure the HPSM Collector, execute the following steps:

*   **Step 1: Change Directory**

	Change the current working directory to the `hpsm` directory of your Hygieia source code installation.

	For example, in the Windows command prompt, run the following command:

	```
	cd C:\Users\[username]\hygieia\collectors\cmdb\hpsm
	```

*   **Step 2: Run Maven Build**

	Run the maven build to package the collector into an executable JAR file:

	```bash
	mvn install
	```

	The output file `hpsm-collector.jar` is generated in the `hpsm\target` folder.

*   **Step 3: Set Parameters in Application Properties File**

	Set the configurable parameters in the `application.properties` file to connect to the Dashboard MongoDB database instance, including properties required by the HPSM Collector.

	To configure parameters for the HPSM Collector, refer to the sample [application.properties](#sample-application-properties-file) file.

	For information about sourcing the application properties file, refer to the [Spring Boot Documentation](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-external-config-application-property-files).

*   **Step 4: Deploy the Executable File**

	To deploy the `hpsm-collector.jar` file, change directory to `hpsm\target`, and then execute the following from the command prompt:

	```bash
	java -Dcollector.action=[action] -jar hpsm-collector.jar --spring.config.name=hpsm --spring.config.location=[path to application.properties file]
	```
	
	Note: ```[action]``` is either ```Hpsm```, ```HpsmIncident``` or ```HpsmChange``` and defaults to ```Hpsm``` if ```-Dcollector.action``` is not specified.

### Sample Application Properties File

The sample `application.properties` file lists parameters with sample values to configure the HPSM Collector. Set the parameters based on your environment setup.
