You can use GitHub webhooks to publish commit information to the Feature widget in the Hygieia dashboard. If you use webhooks, you need not run the GitHub collector.

Your Github webhookâ€™s payload URL should be set to: `http://hygieia-base-url/api/commit/github/v3`.

Select the option of publishing just the **push** events.
