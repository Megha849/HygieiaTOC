The pipeline view showcases the code progression through each componentâ€™s lifecycle in the software delivery process, from initial development to the final, product deployment.

As the following screenshot shows, the screen offers immediate analysis of code progression:

In addition, you can evaluate the code progression through its various stages through the delivery pipeline. As shown above, there is a list of executable packages with the corresponding version deployed at each stage in the delivery pipeline. Finally, the date under the version number indicates the package deployment date.

## Configure the Pipeline View

To configure your delivery pipeline through the pipeline stages:

1. In the Pipeline tab of your team dashboard, click **Configure widget**. This invokes the **Configure Delivery Pipeline** pop-up window. 
2. In the **Configure Delivery Pipeline** pop-up window, enter the following details:
   - Click Add to enter the pipeline stage and then select the environment.
   - Once you have selected an environment for each for the pipeline stage you want to configure, choose the radio button to indicate the production stage, and then click **Save**.

The Pipeline View is displayed for the configured environments.

The following screenshot shows the **Configure Delivery Pipeline** pop-up window:
