## Prerequisites:

Before creating a product dashboard, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

1. A Team Dashboard is created 
2. **Build** and **Code Repo** widgets are configured on the team dashboard

The process to create a Team Dashboard and configure the widgets is explained in the following sections.

**Note**: The metrics displayed on the product dashboard are based on the configurations in the team dashboard. If the team dashboard is not configured for a metric, it is not displayed on the product dashboard.

## Create a Team Dashboard

To create a team dashboard:

1. In the **Team Dashboards** tab, click **Create a new dashboard**. This invokes the **Create a New Dashboard** screen.
2. Enter the following details:
   - Select the dashboard type as **Team Dashboard** from the dropdown list.
   - Choose **Select Widgets** radio button to customize the dashboard layout while creating a new dashboard.

### Configure Widgets in the Team Dashboard 

Once you have created the team dashboard, you can configure the widgets that you want to view on your dashboard. To add the team dashboard to the product dashboard, it is mandatory to configure the **Code Repo** and **Build widget**.

#### Configure the Code Repo Widget

1. Click **Configure widget** to invoke the **Configure Repo Widget** screen. In this screen, enter the following details:
   - Select the **Repo Type** from the dropdown list:
     - GitHub
	 - Subversion
	 - Bitbucket
	 - Gitlab
   - Enter the **Repo URL** for the selected Repo Type
   - Enter the **Branch** for the repo. The repo branch is not applicable for Subversion.
   - Enter the repo login **Credentials**. This is not applicable for Gitlab.
   - Enter the **API Key** for a private Gitlab repo. 
   - Enter the **Personal Access Token** for a GitHub repo. For details on generating a Personal Access Token for GitHub, see the [GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/).
   
2. Click **Save**. The Code Repo widget is configured for the selected repo.

This widget displays code contribution data as follows:

- A graphical representation of the number of issues, pulls, and commits per day versus time intervals (i.e., starting with the current day and going back the previous 14 days)
- A summary of all the commits, pulls, and issues. This area also shows how many commitors, contributors, and ideators are involved. Moreover, for all six of these categories they align with the days last worked on, beginning with today and going back the previous 14 days.

#### Configure Build Widget

The Jenkins collector displays build-related details in the build widget. To configure the build widget:

1. Click **Configure widget** to invoke the **Configure Build Widget** screen. In this screen, enter the following details:
   - Enter the Build Job 
   - Enter the Build Duration Threshold (in minutes). The default duration is 3 minutes.
   - Alert Takeover Criteria indicates the number of consecutive build fails. The default number is 5.
2. Click **Save**. The Build Widget is configured for the selected repo.

This widget displays the following build information, beginning with the current day and going back the previous 14 days:

- A graphical representation of the number of builds per day
- A summary of the total number of builds for the application
- A graphical depiction of the average build duration

## Create a Product Dashboard

To configure the product dashboard:

To create a product dashboard:

1. Click **Create a new dashboard**. The **Create a New Dashboard** screen is invoked.
2. Enter the following details:
   - Select the dashboard type as **Product Dashboard** from the dropdown list.
   - Enter the dashboard title. The title should have a minimum of 6 characters and should not contain any special characters (for example, !, #, &, _).
   - Enter the **Application Name**.
   - Enter a business service name. This is an optional value.

### Configure the Product Dashboard

To configure a Product Dashboard:

- In the product dashboard screen, click **Add a Team**. Enter the following details in the **Add team** pop-up window:
   - Select a team dashboard from the drop-down list. The list displays all team dashboards created in Hygieia.
   - Optionally, specify a custom team name, and then click **Add this team**.

**Note**: Configure the Build and Code Repository before adding the team to the Product Dashboard.

### Information on the Product Dashboard

The product dashboard displays averages and trends calculated over a 90-day period.

- **DevOps Maturity Score** – Quantitative score that measures the application’s DevOps maturity level.
- **90-day Pipeline Health** - This segment displays trends to enable easy access to important DevOps metrics over a 90-day period. The various trends displayed include the number of unit and functional tests passed as well as code coverage per day. These metrics also enable you to measure code and security issues, build success, and time taken to fix builds.

At each of the different development stages, the Product view shows the number of commits waiting to move to the next stage, thus amplifying the wait-times between stages. Thus, the Product View enables teams to reduce the wait-time and speed up the continuous delivery pipeline. 

The product dashboard gives in-depth details by highlighting the standard code deviations at each stage:
- The green boxes at a development stage indicate the number of commits that do not exceed 2 standard deviations.
- The red boxes indicate that have commits have exceeded over 2 standard deviations.
