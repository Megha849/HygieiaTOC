## Brief Overview of Hygieia's Dashboards

There are two separate Hygieia dashboards. One dashboard is for engineers and thus offers metrics, among other details, in an extremely drilled down manner. These dashboards are as follows:

- Team Dashboard
- Product Dashboard

The other dashboard is intended for executives who, if they so choose, can either read at a higher level or can opt to also dig into additional details. For information on this dashboard, see the [Hygieia Executive](https://hygieia.github.io/ExecDashboard/Introduction.html) documentation.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin to configure your dashboard in Hygieia, make sure the following prerequisites are met:

- The following components of Hygieia are configured:
  - Database Layer 
  - UI Layer
  - API Layer
  - Tool collectors
  
For detailed instructions on configuring each of the components of Hygieia, see the [Installing Hygieia](../hygieia/setup.md) section in the documentation.
  
- If you are configuring Hygieia using Docker, make sure the Docker Instances are up and running for all components of Hygieia.
  For detailed instructions on configuring a Docker Image, see the [Build Docker](../hygieia/Build/builddocker.md) section in the documentation.
  
Continue setting up your dashboard if all the prerequisites are met.
