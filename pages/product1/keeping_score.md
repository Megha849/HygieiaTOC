Team Dashboard scores encourage teams to fully configure the CI/CD pipeline by evaluating the widgets based on a set of metrics.

**Note:** Scoring your team dashboard is optional. However, it has the potential to foster healthy competitiveness within your organization.

By keeping score for the team dashboards, you are able to:

- Achieve DevOps maturity by giving scores based on algorithms
- Challenge the team to increase their scores on the team dashboard
- Keep code repositories clean and encourage practices required for quality assurance

Each widget has a score that is based on good practices for that widget. For example, the Source Code Management widget, also known as the Code Repo widget, will have a 5-star score if you are using Pull Requests (PRs), and are integrating to the master branch at least once per day for each developer on the team.

The Gamification module displays an overall score for your team dashboard by considering the star rating of the following widgets:

| Widget | Scoring Criteria |
|--------|------------------|
| Code Repo | Rated on the number of commits and use of PRs for integrating to the master branch. For example, data is present for more than or equal to 60% days for the last 14 days. In addition, the team is integrating to the master branch at least once per day for each developer in the team. |
| Build | Rated on the status and duration of the build  (for the past 14 days) |
| Quality | Rated on code coverage (less than 20%), unit tests passed, and violation data. Violations is calculated as: ```100 - ((blockers * 20) + (critical * 5) + (major * 1))```. Here, **blockers**, **critical**, and **major** indicate the severity level for a violation |
| Deploy | Rated on deployment success and the number of deploy instances that are online |

Each widget is given a star rating on a scale from 0 to 5, with 5 stars being the highest score for each widget. Hygieia in turn calculates the overall score of the team dashboard, which is an aggregate of the individual widget ratings. The widgets are given equal weight while rating the team dashboard. The score of the widgets is combined and aggregated to determine the overall score for the team dashboard.
